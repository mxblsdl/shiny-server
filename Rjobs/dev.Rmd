A POC for scraping the Rstudio community job board and pulling the table of jobs activity.

First set base URL then read and format as table. Currently only reads the top 30 posts since the website is set as a crawler. Need to determine how to read more of these entries.

```{r}
webpage <- "https://community.rstudio.com/c/jobs/20"

table <- read_html(webpage) %>% 
  html_table()

table <- table[[1]]

table %>% 
  select(Topic, Replies, Views, Activity) %>% 
  mutate(Topic = gsub("\n.*", "", Topic))
```
