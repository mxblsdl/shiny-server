# How I built this
## Check that dev does not push
Notes on my process for getting this site up...

1) Shiny server
  - Dean's blog
  - updates for R 4
2) Setup in git
  - setting up webhooks
  - mostly using [this blog](https://ansonvandoren.com/posts/deploy-hugo-from-github/)
  - with some updates on the webhook service 
  - updates on the working directory
  - firewall setup
3) This page was made with R markdown
4) sign in as user shiny to install packages
  - This requires setting a password for user shiny
  `sudo passwd shiny` enter password
  - changing PAM permissions for rstudio server
  - navigate to 
```{bash}
etc/rstudio/rserver.conf
```
  - edit file to include `auth-minimum-user-id=100`
  - if there is no setting it will default to 1000
  - my shiny user had the UID of 996 which prohibited that user from logging in
  - run `sudo rstudio-server restart` to make sure changes to propagated
  - **Note on installing packages** some packages have requirements outside of R and will require installation of some linux libraries. This will have to be done by a user who has `sudo` privileges, shiny user probably won't. I found the package install error messages to be helpful in these instances.
5) Additional fun thing for rstudio login
  - add a `login.html` file to `etc/rstudio/` and this will display additional HTML below the default login page
  - additional CSS can be added here as well
