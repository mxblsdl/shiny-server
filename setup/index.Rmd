# How I built this

Notes on my process for getting this site up...

1) Shiny server
  - Dean's blog
  - updates for R 4
2) Setup in git
  - setting up webhooks
  - mostly using [this blog](https://ansonvandoren.com/posts/deploy-hugo-from-github/)
  - with some updates on the webhook service 
  - updates on the working directory
  - firewall setup
3) This page was made with R markdown
