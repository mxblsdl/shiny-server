# How I built this

Notes on my process for getting this site up...

1) Shiny server
  - I mostly followed [Dean Attali's](https://deanattali.com/2015/05/09/setup-rstudio-shiny-server-digital-ocean/) blog about how to get RStudio and Shiny server set up. This was the inspiration and guiding document for this project. The steps outlined in Dean's blog get a Digital Ocean linux server setup.
  
  - I made some updates to the blog, most notably getting the most recent version of R and RStudio Server. I followed the [instructions from Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-r-on-ubuntu-20-04) to install the latest version of R. This was a significant change since you are required to add a CRAN repository to your Ubnutu server.
  
2) Setup in git
  - The above steps got my set up with Github and my workflow was:
    1) Development on local machine and push changes to Github.
    2) Log into server, navigate to `shiny-server` directory and pull changes.
  - I knew webhooks were a thing so I thought it would be great if my server pulled changes that I made locally without having to log in and manually pull from Github.
  - I mostly used [this blog](https://ansonvandoren.com/posts/deploy-hugo-from-github/) to get webhooks set up.
  - I changed the redeploy script to a more stripped down version that only changes directories and does a `git pull`.
```{bash}
REMOTE_REPO=https://github.com/mxblsdl/shiny-server.git

WORKING_DIRECTORY=$HOME/staging_area
# Location (server block) where Nginx looks for content to serve
PUBLIC_WWW=/var/www/html
# Backup folder in case something goes wrong during this script
BACKUP_WWW=$HOME/backup_html

cd /srv/shiny-server
git pull
  ```
I also made some updates to my webhook service file. This is the file keeps the redeploy script running when I'm not logged onto the server.
```{bash}
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/home/max
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/webhook -hooks /opt/hooks/hooks.json -hotreload
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- Most notably the working directory changed to accommodate the RStudio server user structure and I used the hotreload flag. I also changed the `WantedBy` to `multi-user.target`. I'm not an expert on service files, but this setup worked for me and got my webhooks recognized. 

- Another change from the webhooks blog was setting up a firewall for my DO droplet. My original `sudo ufw status` was inactive. So I activated the firewall and made sure to add ports `3838` for Shiny Server and `8787` for RStudio.

3) Adding packages for your shiny application.
- As noted in Dean's blog, shiny apps run as user `shiny`. This means that any packages that are required for your shiny app need to be available globally to all users. While you can run the command

```{bash}
sudo su - -c "R -e \"install.packages('shiny', repos='http://cran.rstudio.com/')\""
```

from your linux DO terminal I thought it would be easier if you could just log into RStudio Server as user shiny and install packages from an R Studio session.

This requires two steps:
  1) You need to set a password for user `shiny` so they can access RStudio Server. Any user needs a password to access your instance of RStudio so putting this into context more, `shiny` is treated as a normal user.
```{bash}
sudo passwd shiny
# end new password at prompt
```
  2) I had to edit the PAM permissions for user `shiny`. I really don't know what PAM permissions are exactly but found a couple SO threads that pointed to this as an issue. I also found the [RStudio Server documentation](https://docs.rstudio.com/ide/server-pro/1.2.1502-1/r-sessions.html#pam-sessions) to be helpful in explaining PAM permissions *and many other things about RStudio Server*.

  - To change the PAM permissions navigate to 

```{bash}
etc/rstudio/rserver.conf
# sudo vim etc/rstudio/rserver.conf # if you chose vim as your editor
```
  
  - and edit the file to include the line `auth-minimum-user-id=100`
  - If there is no setting the minimum user id will default to 1000
  - my shiny user had a UID of 996, which prohibited that user from logging in to RStudio.
  - run `sudo rstudio-server restart` to make sure changes to propagated
Now you should be able to login as user `shiny`, install packages that will be directly available in your shiny applications.

- **Note on installing packages** some packages have requirements outside of R and will require installation of some linux libraries. This will have to be done by a user who has `sudo` privileges, shiny user probably won't. I found the package install error messages to be helpful in these instances.

4) Additional fun thing for RStudio login
  - add a `login.html` file to `etc/rstudio/` and this will display additional HTML below the default login page
  - additional CSS can be added here as well 
  - Make sure to run:
```{bash}
sudo rstudio-server restart 
```
