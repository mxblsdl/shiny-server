While my background is in natural resource management and environmental sciences I have moved to a more data-centric role with a focus on analysis and process. During college I became involved with GIS and was drawn to the blend of design and quantitative analysis which GIS offers.

GIS led me to programming with R which expanded my mind to the power of programming for analytics and other applications. Programming gamified work and learning for me and I have worked towards understanding the different tools and how to make effective quantitative choices with them.
