This site and all of its contents are made with 
<a href = "https://shiny.rstudio.com/" target = "_blank" >R Shiny</a>. I was in a meeting with a C Suite executive and someone brought up using Shiny for a project. Before I agree and say how excited I was to work on this project, the exec said 
>"Shiny is only good when you need to run R code in the background""

I thought, why not use Shiny to make a user interface for a 'normal' website. Here we are. This is all self hosted and set up by me. I [wrote out the steps](../setup/) to get Shiny Server running, including setting up webhooks to automatically pull changes from GitHub.
