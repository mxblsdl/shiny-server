Portland Urban Forestry conducted a [tree inventory](https://www.portland.gov/trees/get-involved/treeinventory) along Portland's streets and parks.

The project generated data on tree location and many other attributes which they made publicly available. I have chosen to display some of that data using R Shiny in a completely free and open source way.

This project was partially motivated by the [current web app](https://pdx.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=b4671f4591144530b1c590731923b182), which I think could be improved upon and which is made with proprietary software.
